# Operation Code Freeze üêß üßä

Hey there! Welcome to `operation-code-freeze`, where I'll be sharing my adventure from Buenos Aires, Argentina, all the way down to Antarctica (and back up through Santiago, Chile). This repo is a collection of [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) notebooks that document my cruise on the [Holland America](https://www.hollandamerica.com/) ship, the _Oosterdam_, from December 16th to January 6th - more or less during the holiday code freeze. üòÑ

You'll find all sorts of details in these notebooks: data visualizations of weather conditions, interactive Python maps of the journey, lots of pictures of penguins, and even some experiments using Google's latest Gemini 2.0 models. Oh, and did I mention penguins? This whole trip was inspired by those adorable little guys, and I've made sure to document all the penguin encounters along the way (including a checklist for the penguin species the _Oosterdam_ encountered).

## Journey Overview

So far, the _Oosterdam_ has cruised from Buenos Aires down the coast, visited some incredible places, hung out with penguins in the Antarctic, and (in a few days time) will loop back up through the Drake Passage to Patagonia and the Chilean fjords. 

Here's a quick rundown of some of the places visited along the way:

*   Buenos Aires
*   Montevideo
*   Punta del Este
*   Puerto Madryn
*   Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (Stanley)
*   Antarctica (Palmer Archipelago, Danco Coast, Antarctic Sound)
*   Ushuaia
*   Punta Arenas
*   The Chilean Fjords (including Amalia/Brujo Glaciers, Sarmiento Channel, Strait of Magellan)
*   Puerto Chacabuco
*   Puerto Montt
*   San Antonio (Santiago)

## Notebooks

Here's a look at the notebooks I've put together so far. More are on their way, so stay tuned!

### Future Notebooks
*   Additional notebooks will be added to cover the remaining legs of the journey. Stay tuned!

## Tools of the Trade

*   **Google Colab:** Platform for writing code in Python, and sharing notebooks (now with AI assistance, powered by Gemini).
*   **Python:**  For all the data wrangling, visualizations, and Gemini experiments.
*   **Gemini 2.0, Imagen, Veo 2, and AI Studio:** Used for multimodal and streaming AI experiments.

## How to Dive In

1.  Just click on the notebook file that you're interested in (they have a `.ipynb` extension).
2.  Then, hit the `Open in Colab` button and you can play around with the code right in your browser!

## A big thank you üôè

This adventure wouldn't have been possible without a few key players:

*   **Starlink:** For keeping the internet connection strong even in most remote locations! It was amazing to be able to stay connected to the world.
*   **Holland America:** The crew and staff of the _Oosterdam_ have been simply wonderful! They kept us all safe, entertained, and well-fed throughout the journey.
*   **Gemini DeepMind, Labs, and Google AI Studio teams:** For the fantastic tools that made it possible to experiment with Gemini, Imagen, and Veo 2, and to create awesome projects.
*   **Google Colab:** A big shout out for making creating notebooks, and sharing code and ideas, so dang easy!
